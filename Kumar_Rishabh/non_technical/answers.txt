1. How do you stay updated about topics in Flutter/Dart and active in the community? (Discord/Slack/MeetUps/Twitter)
A)
Reddit: Reddit is actually the most important source of news for Flutter for me. And not just the news but also what general opinion about it is
in the industry, coz in the comment section you can find comments from all class of people and mostly more experienced ones who are actually
working in the industry. Two of the subreddits that I am in are r/FlutterDev and r/FlutterHelp. It also comes in handy when I am stuck and need some help in my code.

YouTube: Well of course, the official Flutter YouTube channel is the main source for any new package, widget or feature release. They even had the Event on the release of Flutter 2
with null safety and stable Web app support. There are always updates on the channel and also the classic Boring flutter development show with Phillip.

Discord: I am currently in two of the servers - AppBeweryFlutter and FlutterBuddies. The discord helped me a lot when I was got a bug in my current internship.

Twitter: I currently follow few people on Twitter who I found from Medium article or YouTube.

Medium: This is no doubt the best place to read article more technical topics.

2. Your most used IDE/keyboard shortcuts when coding. (for Flutter/Dart)
A) I use AndroidStudio for flutter development. I mostly just use the simple save (CTRL+S) and that also Hot Reloads the app. When it comes to Hot Restart, I just use mouse.
Apart from that I use CTRL+SHIFT+M to toggle between the opening and closing brackets.

3. How do you approach responsiveness when coding an entire screen? (You can attach code snippet for better explanation).
A) Well in case of Flutter, getting responsiveness is much easier than say HTML/CSS. Just adjusting the properties like mainAxisAlignment, crossAxisAlignment for columns
and rows. The EXPANDED widget together with the 'flex' properties also comes in handy. Apart from that in the worst cases we can use something like MediaQuery.of(context)
to get the width and height and use it to set the size of containers or any other widget.
