1. Attach a pubspec.yaml file from one of your past flutter projects.

A) Add file to "technical" folder => Added


2. What is your understanding of the term “State Management” when talking about Flutter App Development. Explain it in your own words.

A) State is basically how the User Interface of the app feels/behaves at a particular moment. It holds the data
   that are needed in order to render the UI. And whenever we change/set the state the build() function is triggered,
   resulting in the re-rendering of the User Interface. Now there are different way how we can manage the state or 
   how we can transform the state into UI. For local state, we generally use setState(), but for global state we use something
   like InheritedWidget() or ChangeNotifier/ValueNotifier. And these techniques require much more boilerplate code, thats why
   several state management libraries have been introduced, each of them having their own pros and cons. 


3. When/Where do you usually encounter bugs in your development process?

A) Mostly when I forget to check if the data fetched from local cache or remote database is null.
   And when not catching the exceptions with try-catch block, the unhandled exceptions sometimes cause bugs.
   The `type error` sometimes becomes error-prone when not specifying data types in the fromJson() method, i.e., final int accuracy = data['accuracy'] as int .
   Also `asynchronous suspension`, `the getter was called on null`, `RangeError: Index out of range` these are some common errors I face quite often.
