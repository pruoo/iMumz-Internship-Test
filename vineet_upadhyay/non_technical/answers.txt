1. How do you stay updated about topics in Flutter/Dart and active in the community? (Discord/Slack/MeetUps/Twitter)
A) Flutter has a growing community of developers, and there are plenty of resources.
My personal resources are mostly Reso-Coder, Flutter Channels on Medium, and sometimes Tadas Petra's discord Server

2. Your most used IDE/keyboard shortcuts when coding. (for Flutter/Dart)
A) VS Code with with tools like "Pubspec Assist", "Dart Import", etc.
Currently using the "Abyss" theme.

3. How do you approach responsiveness when coding an entire screen? (You can attach code snippet for better explanation).
A) While approaching responsiveness, the key is to breakdown the UI into smaller components.
Giving fixed constraints is one of the worst approaches to this and hence, I tend to define the constraints
using the Screen Width/ Screen Height. Use of MediaQueries, LayoutBuilder and other non-bounded widgets such as
Expanded and Flexible is my goto approach.
