1. Attach a pubspec.yaml file from one of your past flutter projects.
A) Add file to "technical" folder

2. What is your understanding of the term “State Management” when talking about Flutter App Development. Explain it in your own words.
A) State Management in a layman's language means to manage the "State" of data shown on the screen. In any framework, the key is to
seperate the UI from the Business Logic, so as to facilitate accessibilty of "state variables". There could be various approaches to State Management - 
Bloc, Provider, Riverpod, and my personal favorite - Get, allow us to manage the "state" efficiently, by segregating our Logic from the Frontend.

3. How do you approach responsiveness when coding an entire screen? (You can attach code snippet for better explanation).
A) While approaching responsiveness, the key is to breakdown the UI into smaller components.
Giving fixed constraints is one of the worst approaches to this and hence, I tend to define the constraints
using the Screen Width/ Screen Height. Use of MediaQueries, LayoutBuilder and other non-bounded widgets such as
Expanded and Flexible is my goto approach.

4. When/Where do you usually encounter bugs in your development process?
A) As a developer, the most critical areas where I encounter bugs is when working with
asynchronous data. Due to the nature of the data received, it is very essential to test such APIs on Postman, before usage.
Apart from asynchronous data, package versioning issues also arise from time-to-time.
