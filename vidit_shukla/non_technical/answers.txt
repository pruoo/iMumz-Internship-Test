1. How do you stay updated about topics in Flutter/Dart and active in the community? (Discord/Slack/MeetUps/Twitter)
A) Mostly I stay updated about Flutter throught the discord serve of FlutterDev and Codepur, and through various live sessions conducted by 
Flutter team on youtube which makes me aware about the various latest features in Flutter.Besides this, I follow Pawan Kumar, which also keeps me updated.

2. Your most used IDE/keyboard shortcuts when coding. (for Flutter/Dart)
A)
My Most used keyboard shortcut is ctrl+shift+R , which helps me to extract any wiget from code and to wrap any widget into 
any other widget, which helps me in efficient as well as faster coding.
My second most used shortcut is shift+alt+F , which helps me to refactor the code, as every page in flutter is a widget tree
it makes extremely easy to navigate to any widget from the refactored code.

3. How do you approach responsiveness when coding an entire screen? (You can attach code snippet for better explanation).
A) 
 I use MediaQuery and Aspect Ratio, MediaQuery to get the on screen width and height of screen as well as the orientation 
 of the screen and then use Aspect Ratio to achieve my desired resolution for any widget in order to achieve responsiveness and I try to use
 as many responsive widget as possible while coding to increase my command on responsivess. I also use expand and flexible commands
 to make the children of rows and column fit in available space.
